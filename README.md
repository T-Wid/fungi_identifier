<h1>Capstone Project C964</h1>


<h2> Description </h2>

<p> 
This project is meant to meet the standards for the assessment of the WGU Capstone Course. 
The project is a machine learning program meant to identify if mushrooms are toxic or non-toxic for consumption. 
This project is meant to be a web application that could be used by the public. The program uses attributes of mushrooms to determine the toxicity of the mushroom.
</p>


<h2> Topic </h2>

<p>
Using machine learning algorithms, the program is intended to idenfity mushrooms and classify them as toxic or not. The characteristics of the mushrooms are the determining factor.
</p>


<h2> Data </h2>

<p>
The dataset used by this program is courtesy of the University of California Irvine. This dataset has multiple attributes for thousands of species of mushrooms.
