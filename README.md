# fungi_identifier
An image recognition project to identify toxic vs non-toxic mushrooms

<h1>Capstone Project C964</h1>


<h2> Description </h2>

<p> 
This project is meant to meet the standards for the assessment of the WGU Capstone Course. 
The project is a machine learning program meant to identify if mushrooms are toxic or non-toxic for consumption. 
This project is meant to be a web application that could be used by the public. The program uses attributes of mushrooms to determine the toxicity of the mushroom.
</p>


<h2> Topic </h2>

<p>
Using machine learning algorithms, the program is intended to identify mushrooms and classify them as toxic or not. The characteristics of the mushrooms are the determining factor.
</p>


<h2> Data </h2>

<p>
The dataset used by this program is courtesy of the University of California Irvine. This dataset has multiple attributes for thousands of species of mushrooms.
</p>


<h2> Directions </h2>

<p>
Copy and paste the following command: `pip install pandas scikit-learn Flask seaborn` Next, download the Python program from its source, which might be hosted on platforms like GitHub. After downloading, navigate to the directory where the program is located using the terminal or command prompt. You can use the `cd` command followed by the path to the program's directory. With the terminal or command prompt in the program's directory, you can run the Flask application by executing the `app.py` file. To do so, type: `python app.py` Once the Flask app is running, it will start the development server, and you'll see output indicating that the server is running, along with the localhost URL and port number where the app is hosted.

 	To interact with the Flask application, open a web browser and navigate to the specified localhost URL and port number. Usually, this URL is `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` or `http://localhost:5000/`, where `5000` is the default port number used by Flask.
